#### CSS

1. Use d3 do gives elements of a selection a class.
  ```javascript
  datagroups.append("circle")
    .attr("class", "datapointCircle")
  ;
  ```
2. Use `CSS` to change styles or initiate CSS animations on hover
  ```css
  .datapointCircle:hover{
    opacity: 1;
  }
  ```

Tip: in order to not pollute class names, remember css selectors, like
```css
.datagroup circle:hover{
  opacity: 1;
}
```
CSS gives solutions to more complex situations, too. Use Google, experiment. See what this does, for example:
```CSS
.datagroup:hover circle{
  opacity: 1;
}
```

#### Event Listeners in D3

D3's documentation on [Handling Events](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#handling-events)
```javascript
// this adds the same event listener
// to every element in a given selection
// we can react to all kinds of events (reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#Standard_events)
selection.on("mouseover", function(){
  console.log("hovered");
});
```
We can do whatever we want inside the callback function. What do you think the following code will do?
```javascript
selection.on("click", function(){
  selection
      .transition()
      .duration(1000)
      .attr("opacity", 0)
      .remove()
  ;
});
```
...not so sensical. Often you will want to do something to or with the element that was interacted with. You can select it like this:
```javascript
selection.on("click", function(){
  d3.select(this)
      .transition()
      .duration(1000)
      .attr("transform", "scale(2)")
  ;
});
```
...I am using `transform: scale(2)` to make my generally applicable. Of course, you can use more specific attributes, like `r` for circles or `width` for rectangles, etc.

Challenge: How could we select all elements EXCEPT the one interacted with. There is many solutions, here is one:
```javascript

selection.on("mouseover", function(d){
  // we filter out d from the selection and transition the rest
  selection.filter(function(datapoint){ return d!=datapoint; })
      .transition()
      .duration(1000)
      .attr("transform", "scale(2)")
  ;

});
```

#### Mini Project

Our data is an array containing elements like
```javascript
{
  date: Thu Jan 01 1942 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time) {}
  description: ""
  event: "Manhattan project develops the atom bomb"
  hidden: ""
  type: "science"
}
```
Let's try to always display the `event` line above our visualization whenever we hover a circle (and make it disappear when out mouse moves out).

To start, we create **one** text element the content of which we then just keep on refreshing. So somewhere at the top of our file we can write something like this:
```javascript
let infotext = viz.append("text")
  // .text("blablablbalablablabla")
  .attr("x", w/2)
  .attr("y", padding/2)
  .attr("text-anchor", "middle")
  .attr("font-family", "sans-serif")
  .attr("fill", "#ff5333")
;
```
note, I gave some random text while positioning and styling the element, then commented it out. Giving the element a variable name (`infotext`) will make it easier to refer to it in our `mouseover` function:
```javascript
datagroups.selectAll("circle").on("mouseover", function(d){
  let text = d.event; // get the text from the datapoint
  infotext.text(text); // change the text of the infotext element
});
```
##### make text disappear on `mouseout`
Great, next you can use `mouseout` event handler to make the text disappear when we leave the element.

##### tooltip

Explore what `selection.on` ([reference](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_on)) and `d3.pointer` ([reference](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#pointer)) gives you. Use it to build a "tooltip" or, in other words, use it to adjust the position of the infoText to make it feel like a pop up text.

concepts to distinguish:
```
event.clientX
event.pageX
d3.pointer(event, this)
d3.pointer(event, this.parent)
```
all these give you the mouse position in reference to different points (d3.pointer let's you easily calculate the position in reference to any element in your viz, but it take a little practice to get a hang of!)
