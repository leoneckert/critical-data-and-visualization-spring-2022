### Descriptions: Generators, Components & Layouts
The following descriptions are taken from [*D3.js in Action, Second Edition*](https://livebook.manning.com/book/d3js-in-action-second-edition/about-this-book/) by Elijah Meeks.

> Generators
>
> D3 generators consist of functions that take data and **return the necessary SVG drawing code** to create a graphical object based on that data. For instance, if you have an array of points and you want to draw a line from one point to another, [...] a few D3 functions can help you with this process. These generators simplify the process of creating a complex SVG<path> by abstracting the process needed to write a <path>d attribute.

examples:
- [d3.line](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/v1.3.5/README.md#line)
- [d3.area](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/v1.3.5/README.md#area)
- [d3.arc](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/v1.3.5/README.md#arc) (used to create the pie pieces of pie charts)
- [d3.pie](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/v1.3.5/README.md#pie)


> Components
>
> In contrast with generators, which produce the d attribute string necessary for a <path> element, components **create an entire set of graphical objects** necessary for a particular chart component. The most commonly used D3 component [...] is d3.axis, which creates a bunch of `<line>`, `<path>`, `<g>`, and `<text>` elements that are needed for an axis based on the scale and settings you provide the function.

examples:
- [d3.axis](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/tree/v1.0.12)
- [d3.brush](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/v1.1.2/README.md#brush)

> Layouts
>
> In contrast to generators and components, D3 layouts can be rather straightforward, like the pie chart layout, or complex, like a force-directed network layout. Layouts take in one or more arrays of data, and sometimes generators, and **append attributes to the data** necessary to draw it in certain positions or sizes, either statically or dynamically.

examples:
- [d3.tree](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/v1.1.8/README.md#tree)
- [d.cluster](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/v1.1.8/README.md#cluster)
